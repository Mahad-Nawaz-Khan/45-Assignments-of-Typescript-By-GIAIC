/*45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
  It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
  such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned
  to make sure all the information was stored correctly. */
